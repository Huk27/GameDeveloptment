This book is your guide to potion crafting. Here you can find all the information you need on crafting potions! Some information may be revealed as you progress through the game.
 
Potions can be brewed at cauldrons, found in either the [color=green]Wizard's Tower[/color] or the [color=green][if=PLAYER_VISITED_LOCATION Current WitchHut]Witch Hut[/if][else]???[/else][/color]. You can find a copy of this guide near the cauldrons in those locations.
 
(You can also get your own [color=blue]Cauldron[/color] and [color=blue]Purple Book[/color] from the [if=PLAYER_HAS_MET Current Krobus[/if][color=blue]Wizard Catalogue[/color] in [color=red]Krobus[/color]'s shop in the [color=green]Sewers[/color][/if][else][color=green]???[/color][/else], or purchase a [color=blue]Portable Potion Guide[/color] from the shop in [color=green][if=PLAYER_VISITED_LOCATION Current QiNutRoom]Qi's Walnut Room[/if][else]???[/else][/color])",
    "guidebook.introduction.page.brewing": "[center][font=dialogue]Potions[/font][/center]
Potions can be drank to provide a buff, tracked separately from food and drink. This means you can have a food buff, a drink buff, and a potion buff going at the same time.
 
Potions have a base duration of 5 hours, though depending on when you make it and the quality and quanity of ingredients, this may end up being longer.
* Ingredients providing a positive effect will provide a multiplier to the potion duration. The multipliers for all positive effect ingredients are averaged before being applied.
* Ingredients providing a negative effect provide an additional multiplier. Unlike positive effect ingredients, these all apply individually instead of being averaged.
* The quality of the water provided (only applicable to certain water types) will affect the duration as well.
 
The ingredients of your potion determine the effect, though when you brew the potion can boost the strength of the effects.
 
By interacting with a cauldron, you open up a menu for brewing your potions. There are three sections to this menu:
* Water - Different types of water will affect your potion differently. Not required, but useful.
* Ingredients - You can have up to 6 different item types as ingredients for your potion. A total of 40 individual ingredient items will fit in the cauldron.
* A button to brew the potion into an item.",

Different types of water can enhance your potion in different ways. Some water can be obtained by crafting an [color=blue]Empty Cup[/color] and using it on a water source. Most water obtained this way does not have special properties, but there are a few locations that where the water is different.
